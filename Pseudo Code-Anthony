Assignment 5: Pseudo Code



1. Create a file with random numbers if it doesn't exist:
   - Generate 100 random numbers between 0 and 999.
   - Save these numbers to a binary file.

2. Read the binary file:
   - Open the file and read how many numbers are stored.
   - Load all numbers into a list.

3. Define a way to sort numbers using Selection Sort:
   - For each number in the list:
     - Find the smallest number from the unsorted part.
     - Swap it with the current number.
   - Repeat until the list is sorted.

4. Define a way to search for a number using Binary Search (recursively):
   - If the search range is invalid, the number is not found.
   - Find the middle number.
   - If it matches the search number, return found.
   - If the search number is smaller, search the left half.
   - Otherwise, search the right half.

5. Create different analyzers to analyze the data:

   - Duplicate Analyzer:
     - Sort the list.
     - Count how many numbers appear more than once.

   - Missing Number Analyzer:
     - Sort the list.
     - Count how many numbers are missing between the smallest and largest numbers by checking gaps.

   - Search Analyzer:
     - Sort the list.
     - Pick 100 random numbers.
     - For each random number, use binary search to check if it exists in the list.
     - Count how many random numbers were found.

   - Statistics Analyzer:
     - Sort the list.
     - Find the smallest number.
     - Find the largest number.
     - Find the median number (middle value).
     - Find the mode (most frequently occurring number).

6.  In the main program:
   - Load the data from the binary file.
   - If data is missing, show an error.
   - Use each analyzer to analyze the data.
   - Print the results of each analysis.

7. End program with success message.
